# Suricata Et Related

A collection of Suricata and Suricata-related useful resources.

## Motivation

This repo was born from my interest in sharing some of the Suricata-related resources I know with the participants of the 1st Hackathon Hackers
do Bem (Hackers for Good) organized by RNP the Brazilian Network for Education and Research. I decided to create it in the form of a GitHub repository because...
Well, it makes it much easier to share and update, I think!

That's it, I hope you find this useful. If you see anything that could be improved, please, share!! :)
